  ( -- * The CEK abstract machine

    -- | The Swarm interpreter uses a technique known as a
    --   <https://matt.might.net/articles/cek-machines/ CEK machine>.
    --   Execution happens simply by iterating a step function,
    --   sending one state of the CEK machine to the next. In addition
    --   to being relatively efficient, this means we can easily run a
    --   bunch of robots synchronously, in parallel, without resorting
    --   to any threads (by stepping their machines in a round-robin
    --   fashion); pause and single-step the game; save and resume,
    --   and so on.
    --
    --   Essentially, a CEK machine state has three components:
    --
    --   - The __C__ontrol is the thing we are currently focused on:
    --     either a 'UTerm' to evaluate, or a 'Value' that we have
    --     just finished evaluating.
    --   - The __E__nvironment ('Env') is a mapping from variables that might
    --     occur free in the Control to their values.
    --   - The __K__ontinuation ('Cont') is a stack of 'Frame's,
    --     representing the evaluation context, /i.e./ what we are
    --     supposed to do after we finish with the currently focused
    --     thing.  When we reduce the current term to a value, the top
    --     frame on the stack tells us how to proceed.
    --
    --   You can think of a CEK machine as a defunctionalization of a
    --   recursive big-step interpreter, where we explicitly keep
    --   track of the call stack and the environments that would be in
    --   effect at various places in the recursion.
    --
    --   The slightly confusing thing about CEK machines is how we
    --   have to pass around environments everywhere.  Basically,
    --   anywhere there can be unevaluated terms containing free
    --   variables (in values, in continuation stack frames, ...), we
    --   have to store the proper environment alongside so that when
    --   we eventually get around to evaluating it, we will be able to
    --   pull out the environment to use.

    -- itself, and one to execute the thing it loads) corresponds to
    -- the fact that it is equivalent to (in pseudo-Haskell syntax)
    -- 'join . load'.
