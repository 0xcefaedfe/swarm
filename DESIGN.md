- The game should be fun

- There should be multiple viable paths to upgrading and building more
  abstractions.  In other words, we *don't* want a linear chain of
  achievements, where you *must* enable language feature X in order to
  obtain resource Y, which you need in order to enable language
  feature Z, which you need in order to... and so on.

- Ideally, everything in the game should be discoverable just by
  playing.  (This includes the possibility of having an in-game
  tutorial to teach the basics first.)
